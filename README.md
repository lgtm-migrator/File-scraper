## Features
- Recursively copy specific filetypes
- Customise copy directory
- Customise save directory
- Support for as many filetypes as you desire
- Create save directory if it does not exist
- Check for pre-existing files in the save directory to prevent duplicates
- Add file path to the saved file names
- Never duplicates any files or overwrites a file with the same name (as the file path is appended, making each file name unique)


## Installation
The script is designed to be ran from a USB drive, but you can also download the latest release directly onto the target machine.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.6+ (On a USB* or on the target machine)
- Windows 10 (not tested on any other OSs)

*\*If you are planning to use a python install from the USB, please create a shortcut to run the script using Python on the flash drive.*
